# PS4 Payload Sender Guide

## How to install

To install the application, you will need an android device. Then, enable third-party apps in settings and download the [APK file here](http://github.com/valentinbreiz/PS4-Payload-Sender-Android/releases/latest). You can install it now.

## How to use

First, you will need the IP address of your PS4. You will need your Android device to be connected to the same local network as your PS4.

To get the IP address of your PS4, go to Settings > Network > View Connection Status and copy the IP address.

You can now start the exploit on your PS4 and listen for a payload.

Now you can type it in the IP field (and change the port if it's not 9020) and click on connect. Browse for your payload and just send it. The app will reboot automatically after finished.
